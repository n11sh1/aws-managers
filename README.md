# Vision
It's easy AWS manager for everyone.

## Everyone is ...
*NOT HUMAN, BUT THE MACHINE*

# IoT & this system

> If you want to match your instances in time to your work,
> it can be achieved by combining this system with the IoT.

1. Opening / Closing detection of the door. (by the sensor etc...)
2. And then push this system's API. 
(ex.
`/ec2_managers/start_instance/all`
`/ec2_managers/stop_instance/all`)
3. Finally running / stopped our instances, without using AWS management console.

# Feature
